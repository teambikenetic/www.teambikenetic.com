##### About Team Biekentic

We’re sponsored and fully supported by [Bikenetic Full Service Bike Shop](https://www.bikenetic.com/), 201 West Jefferson St, Falls Church VA 22046, phone 703-KEG-RIDE. Thanks to Bikenetic, we also enjoy superb equipment sponsorship from Industry Nine, Kona, Jamis, Raleigh, and Norco in addition to excellent local support from Falls Church businesses: [Stahl Homes LLC](http://stahlhomes.com/), [Cafe Kindred](http://www.cafekindred.com/), and [Clare and Don's Beach Shack](http://www.clareanddons.com/).

We publish a brief, weekly [podcast](https://overcast.fm/itunes1436089238/team-bikenetic-bicycle-shorts). It is public but oriented towards the team or interests of the team. Feel free to subscribe, feedback is welcome. [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/itunes1436089238/team-bikenetic-bicycle-shorts), [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/team-bikenetic-bicycle-shorts/id1436089238?mt=2), or [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/s?fid=233261).

Basically, we have fun in dirt. But we also do lots of public service and outreach: [MORE](http://www.more-mtb.org/) trail-building, [Bike to Work Day](https://www.biketoworkmetrodc.org/) support, [WABA](http://www.waba.org/) advocacy, and [Phoenix Bikes](http://www.phoenixbikes.org/) volunteering.

We started in 2014 with 25 members and now enjoy the pleasant company of ~75. We’re currently the size we want to be, but if you’re interested, get to know us at races and on rides, hang out with us, and let’s see if we’re a good fit for each other. Membership requires a stated annual commitment to racing and volunteering. For our ongoing activity, check us out on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bikeneticx) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/teambikenetic/).
