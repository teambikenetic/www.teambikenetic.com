##### About Team Bikenetic

Weâ€™re sponsored and fully supported by [Bikenetic Full Service Bike Shop](https://www.bikenetic.com/), 201 West Jefferson St, Falls Church VA 22046, phone 703-KEG-RIDE. Thanks to Bikenetic, we also enjoy superb equipment sponsorship from Industry Nine in addition to excellent local support from Falls Church businesses: [Stahl Homes LLC](http://stahlhomes.com/), [Cafe Kindred](http://www.cafekindred.com/), and [Clare and Don's Beach Shack](http://www.clareanddons.com/).

In the past we published a brief, weekly [podcast](https://overcast.fm/itunes1436089238/team-bikenetic-bicycle-shorts). It is public but oriented towards the team or interests of the team. Currently on a break, but might pick the mic back up this season. Feel free to subscribe, feedback is welcome.

Basically, we have fun in dirt. But we also do lots of public service and outreach: [MORE](http://www.more-mtb.org/) trail-building, [Bike to Work Day](https://www.biketoworkmetrodc.org/) support, [WABA](http://www.waba.org/) advocacy, and [Phoenix Bikes](http://www.phoenixbikes.org/) volunteering.

We started in 2014 with 25 members and now enjoy the pleasant company of ~75. Weâ€™re currently the size we want to be, but if youâ€™re interested, get to know us at races and on rides, hang out with us, and letâ€™s see if weâ€™re a good fit for each other. Membership requires a stated annual commitment to racing and volunteering.
